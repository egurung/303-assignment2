## Instructions
Using this class is very simple to do. Firstly, you must have a name for the class, this name does not have to be the name of the employee but can be. 
For a professional/salaried employee you must declare it as a "SalaryEmployee" and then list the qualities of the employee as stated in the SalaryEmployee class.
For a non-professional/hourly employee it is quite simple as well. It's the same steps as for the salaried employee except it would be declared as a "HourlyEmployee"
instead.

An example of this is given as such
SalaryEmployee y("Emily", 1, false, "May 5, 2019", 100500.5);
HourlyEmployee g("Jack", 3, true, "July 5, 2020", 80.0, 15.0);

With the output using the functions shown below:
